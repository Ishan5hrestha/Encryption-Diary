# Encryption-Diary
Hash based encryption.  
Uses two passwords:  
1. One for hashing  
2. Another for confirmation  

Main Key: hahahaa  
confirmation phrase: ofcourse  

Add any .txt file on the root directory and run the code.  
Enter main key then select make to encrypt.  
Select View to decrypt  

This deletes the main txt file and makes new .dovah file  

.set files are for its settings.
