# Encryption-Diary
Hash based encryption.  
Run Installer.py first inside Install folder  
Copy All the files it produces to base folder  
Run Diarist.py and use the key you created in installation  
View the files  
Uses two passwords:  
1. KEY for hashing  
2. CheckPhrase for confirmation  

Main Key: hahahaa  
confirmation phrase: ofcourse  

Add any .txt file on the root directory and run the code.  
Enter main key then select make to encrypt.  
Select View to decrypt  

This deletes the main txt file and makes new .dovah file  

.set files are for its settings.
