PHASE: LOVE!!!
I have come much close to her. We talk more but not much. Her friends tease her when they see me. Its only a matter of time and she will be mine. But I still have a doubt because I don't get to talk to her often.

Recently, my long time crush, Isha keeps looking at me. And her friends too. I doubt whether she likes me or her friend. But I think its her. I don't know how I should talk to her.
She was my exam partner for a long time but I never took a chance. I thought I would never get her.

I can no longer dare to make eye contact with Samikshya. It has been a long time since I am making eye contact with her but spoke nothing. She must be thinking I am too much shy and lack courage.

The girl from 11 no more looks at me. I think I an too slow.
But I feel many girls trying to make eye contact with me .

I feel so handsome nowadays.. :)
