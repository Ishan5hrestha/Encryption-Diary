AM I SO HANDSOME?
It was a day before christmas. I was going to college. After getting off the city rickshaw, I was walking on the ruined road. I was wearing a mask due to pollution. Then I saw a group of 6-7 girls coming towards my direction. As they came close, I peeped at them. Very beautiful and well dressed. They were talking nothing. As they passed by me, one said " Oh I lost my mask". I turned back. Another said "He Â turned (heryo) " . I chuckled. And went to college.
After computer class, I was waiting for class to get empty. It was maths exam that day. Suddenly I saw her. She was looking great. Her friends were giggling. I caught her eyes then suddenly bell rang and I turned. I didn't talk to her. I feel very bad. I hate myself. But am I so handsome? Many girls look at me at street to.
I haven't talked to samikshya yet.

LESSON:
YOU CAN DO IT !!! TALK TO HER!!!
