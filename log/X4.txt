WOW!!!
Friday I went to college at 10:15 to attend computer class. I took computer class and came outside. I was sitting outside canteen . Bell rang. I was walking on the steps, I turned back to see my love. Looked around. Couldn't see her. Took a double look. She was far behind my back looking at me. I looked at her with mild smile. She smiled too. I went to class and kept my bag. Came outside on the balcony. I could see her far near the founders car. She was feeling shy. Her friend was holding her cheek and turning her head towards me. I chuckled.
Isha had already gone. Couldn't meet her. Yesterday I was about to speak to her when BK sir disturbed. I will soon progress.

I was having a headache that day.
After holiday, I decided to go by a tempo. I sat on a tempo watching outside. I saw a couple walking. I  started dreaming how beautiful it would be if I had any girl. Suddenly tempo stopped and a girl of HM entered. I knew her. She was the one who was beside me during HSEB. I talked to her. Her name was Jayshree.  She isn't beautiful though. But I got a girl to talk. There were 3 greenland boys. I felt proud in front of them. Her home was at Dhat. I don't know where it is but pretended to know. We talked about results, our college timetable, college bus etc. She was a talkative girl. Finally, I said bye and got off at my home.
