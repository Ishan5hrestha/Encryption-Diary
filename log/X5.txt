 LIGHT HEART
Today went college at 10:15 for computer presentation. Gave presentation, not good. Went down after class. Kept bag. My love was near founder's car. I went to drink water. Then gathered courage and went to her. On way, she saw me, gave confusing smile. I gave mild smile. Approached her. Asked her percentage. Her friends were nearby. 70% wow... I won..:) congratulated her. Asked about her evening classes. Then said a nice goodbye. Pretended to buy a coupon. Then went to class. My heart became very light. I did it again. She is too cute. I love her...:)

Couldn't talk to Isha, but I think she wanted me to. She looked at me while passing by.

No progress with Samikshya.:(
