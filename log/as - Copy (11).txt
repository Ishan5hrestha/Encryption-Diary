FIRST TRY ON ISHA
Today first day after HSEB result was declared, I went to colege. I wanted to ask Isha but I saw Dewasis talking to her. I felt lost. After 1st period, I went to toilet. When I came out, I saw Isha's section holiday. She just came out of class. I came hurriedly and at the balcony, I asked her her percentage. 71% same as me... Ah... That feeling.. Her smile....:)... Thing that I loath is I didn't say a good bye.. But I will work on it.
At holiday, hostel students had come to colege for may be some classes.
