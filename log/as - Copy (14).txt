ISHA, ONCE MORE

Went to colege at 10:30. After class came down. Saw Isha went past me. I couldn't talk. Put my bag. Came out. Waited for her to return. Was standing in gate. Saw samikshya past by. She was looking little tense. Went to drink water. Isha's group came there. She was standing away near the cycles. It was the chance. I went and spoke to her. About
Isha, aja Kati period xa?
7
8 period kahile kahile hunxa?
Sadhai 8 period nai ho tara hami bhagchhau.
Eh last period maths hola.
Ah,.... Kina?
Hoina, tyetikai.
Ye

With a great smile :)
She always gives a nice smile while talking. I love her :p ;p :*

Now I think samikshya is bored of me. I had started at her in a creepy way. But never spoke a word. I suck.

Computer period was a bit long :(

IT WAS A GLORIOUS DAY. THOUGH SATISFACTORY, IT'S NOT ALL. I NEED TO WORK A LOT TO GET HER. SHE MUST HAVE A DOUBT BY NOW. NO PROBLEM. I LOVE HER AND SHE WILL BE MINE. FOR FATHERLAND!!!!!
