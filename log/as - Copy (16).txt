LOOSER
5/24/16
Everything has end. College is over. I have broken many hearts.

I had added samu on facebook. But didn't talk much. During hseb she was looking at me hoping I would talk. I passed by her without talking. I suck..

Isha, she never liked me. Now I understood. it was her friend who liked me. During hissan exam, I went to drink water. At tap there were laxmi and isha's friend shraddha. When I looked at laxmi, she gave a big smile and looked at shraddha.
Before also, I was sitting outside canteen, isha and her friends came. One talked to a boy in front of me. isha and shraddha were standing farther. Isha never looked at me but shraddha sometimes peeped at me. Now its too late. During hseb still she was looking at me. :(

During hisan exams, I met a new girl, junu. She was beautiful and frank. We sat very close . Sometimes she would even touch my hands. I also occasionally did that. I helped her and she helped too. I waitedfor her to complete and turned pages. But at last exam, while writing cv she hid her address because I was looking. So I felt bad. But it was fun with her. Though I didn't speak much. I sat wordless Looking here and there before exams started. I should have talked to her. Her eyes were so different. When I looked at it, I was motionless as if it was looking past me. We smiled at each other many times. Â But all is over now.

I have nothing left now.. All is over.. I am a looser.. I lost everything.... I achieved nothing. I couldn't utilise my glory days.

I MUST CHANGE !!!!!
