DARK DAYS
6/24/2016 7:46 am

Monsoon has started. Days are dark due to clouds. I am broken. Have nothing to do. Have achieved nothing. Just stay at home thinking about my life. A boring life. Useless life. I feel like dying sometimes. Haven't exercised. Motivation videos don't work on me now. I just sleep sleep and sleep. All my friends are away. Only I am here. I wanted to go. My friends said I have to come. I denied. I am heartbroken. Don't know whom to blame. Don't feel like studying. Nor working out. I sit idle all day in my bed. This is boring life. Everybody tells me to study. But I don't want to. I wanted to goto ktm and study there. Â But when I had come with form, nobody told me to go. Later when everybody went, everybody told me to go.

I learnt a lesson. If I stay home or listen to my family, I will die like a dog. An inglorious death.
