SADNESS
7/10/2016
From few days I am seeing weird dreams. Sometimes I see riding motorcycle and sometimes some unremembered friends. Sometimes my love. Yesterday I went to see Sultan with shubham and karun. Today we had planned to goto namaste jharna with karun, ashish, subham. But canceled because ashish went to take nagarikta and shubham had no money.
Its 10:44 now, lying in my bed. Aja aji are shouting. I can't sleep. I never talk to her nowadays. I hate myself. I want to change.
