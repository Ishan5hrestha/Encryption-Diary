Phase 1:FAILURE IN REVOLUTION

After long time I was called to collage for morning classes. I sat on Faraday section on 4th bench of middle row with Sushant Rai. In the break, I, Nirajan and Shubham went to BK sir to ask about computer classes. He said that computer classes will be given later during end of session.
Knowing this, it became useless for me to study on day class. I talked with Sushant and agreed that we will go
and talk to get us on morning classes.
It was raining. We went to Bimal sir on the office and asked him to change my section. I argued a lot but couldn't convince him. I lost. I felt really bad. I couldn't bring the change.
When I turned back, Sushant had already gone. Even Hariom had left. I had thought i'd return with him. Later I decided to return with Om. I left the bus so that I will go with him. Later he went without even telling me. It started raining heavily. I waited alone for it to stop. When rain lightened, I was going on to tempo stand.
Suddenly I remembered I had no money! I waited for some friends. I saw Ujjwal and Pratik. I asked them for 15 rupees. Ujjwal gave me. I don't feel good asking money.
It was raining still raining lightly. It was my bad day. I was about to reach tempo stand, a beautiful girl of HM was coming with an umbrella. She looked at me. I looked at her. It was a familiar face. She smiled. I couldn't remember who she was. She came closer and closer. I thought if she was an old school friend. Finally i
recalled. She was the girl who was with me in HSEB exam's first day. She smiled. I asked
"What's up?"
"Fine, collage over?"
"Yes, Just."
then we went on our ways. I smiled to myself and felt good. I went home thinking about my failed mission. Failing in a revolution hurts more than failing in exams.
I also learnt that never to be dependent. And don't wait for anyone.
