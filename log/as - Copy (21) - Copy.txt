DARE AND THE WORLD YIELDS!!!

At 4, I called her. We were to meet at Shanti chowk. But shit! I forgot the way. Asked her to come near neuro hospital. She was little late. I called 15 minutes later. And went to place she said she was walking through. Saw her wearing mask. She handshaked tight. We talked. Well she was the one to do most talking. I just ran out of topics. But I called her beautiful ;). We went to devkota chowk, went to same hotel I and Karun had eaten. I opened the door for her and pulled chair. Gave her menu. She didn't like buff. So ordered chicken. But not available. So ordered veg. Ate and chat. I was just blank. Couldn't think of anything. Â She ate very little. I paid!!:D 120. I expected more. Then walked her back. I should have asked her to stay a little. Then we went home. She messaged on fb at night, as always. She is a very confident girl.

But somewhere deep I didn't feel so great. I didn't feel such excitement like my old love (crush). And I also feel like betraying my friend. I know, this relationship even if succeeded, mustn't last long, for my old friendship.

But I feel good now. I like her. I like Isha.

All other stories have faded away....
