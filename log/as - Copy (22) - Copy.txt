PAIN
November 1, 2016

I never thought I would be into her like this. I really love her. She has gone India just for a week but I feel very bad for not getting to talk to her. Just today morning she went. I feel very sad without her. I never felt such pain ever in my life. I haven't proposed her, but we like each other. We talk like we are in a relationship. Yesterday, laxmi puja, I went around with her. We roamed a lot. It was the best feeling every. I Â touched her on the back. She eventually used to grab my arm. She is a simple girl. She told me everything about her. She is just soo innocent. She has melted me. I couldn't sleep whole night thinking about the time we spent together, the time we will spend and the time we will be separated. I don't want to.get away from her. By the time she returns, I will be at KTM. We didn't even take a photo. I feel very sad. But then thinking about the time we spent together, it was the best feeling in my life. I don't feel like I gave her a good time but she says she really enjoyed and won't forget this time. I really love her. I've just forgotten all the past stories. Its her. Its just her.

Heyy, yesterday she said that when she first saw me,.she thought I was a playboy!!!

Ahh... Samu!!! Her fb status. Looks like she still misses me. I could just try my luck...... :p

Perhaps I should
