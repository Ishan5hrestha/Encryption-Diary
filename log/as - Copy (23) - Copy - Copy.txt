LOVE LIFE (Kathmandu)


Thus my love life is going well. We talk regularly on phone and also on facebook. I finally told Â her I love her yesterday, on facebook. I wanted to do that in person but she was coming too strong and was talking about our distant relationship. Actually she is the one who has always looking forward on relationship. I always kept her wanting more. She is too eager. But thats what I love. She is very interested in me. We, actually she talks a lot. I am very eager to meet her. I wish the semester ends soon and we will meet soon. But we will have to wait 6 months....

But we will wait and be loyal...... I guess
