BACHELOR

I go to college early at 6:45 to reach college at 7:15. Dont get lot's of sleep. Always feel sleepy. I don't understand anything on the class. I missed a lot's of preparation. I don't remember anything from 11&12. and that's a big problem. Now sports week has started. A week of holiday. M planning to study in this period. Still those days haunt me. I wasn't meant for this college. I didn't deserve so much pain.

But then, I have a love. So many people are desperate for it. But now I have it. We talk daily on phone and facebook. She calls me a lot. I love her so much. Talking to her makes me forget my pains and sorrow. Without her,I would have been soo much depressed. She is the reason I want to live again. I had lost all hopes. But now,I have her. We will be together forever till the end........................
I hope.
