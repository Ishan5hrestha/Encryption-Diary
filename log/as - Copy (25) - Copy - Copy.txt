BREAKUP

Yesterday she told that her eldest sister now knows about us. She told her to breakup with me or she will tell her parents. Because sister's Â love life was destroyed when her parents came to know about that and also her mother became very ill, so she asked my love not to make same mistake. She didn't told it all yesterday. She didn't even reply my texts yesterday. Today morning when I called she told me that we must forget each other. It's not possible for me. I love her so much. Later I called her again. Still she wants to end this.
She told that her sister would come today so I didn't call.
But I had hoped she would call. But in vain. Its 10:12. Still no call. I m restless without talking to her.

I remember her words. She told I was nice and can't find other like me. But still wants to end this in fear of her parents will come to know or our marriage won't happen. She doesn't want to run away and marry because she loves her parents soo much. She also told I wasn't more important to her than her parents. I don't know why I feel suspicious. I don't feel something is right.

I can't even think of my life without her. Hope tomorrow everything will be fine and back to normal.
