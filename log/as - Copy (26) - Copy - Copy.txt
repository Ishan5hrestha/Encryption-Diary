KISS

Today was supposed to be our last meeting. We hadn't been talking so much. We were to meet at 5. But she called and asked to meet early. Reached near Odyssey school at 4:25. She came at 4:35. Met. Talked about things. I couldn't take my eyes off her. She was looking beautiful. I rested my arm on her shoulder. She removed.

We went to same restaurant we first met. I took strawberry milk shake.She took slice. Nothing more. We tasted each other's. Then moved on. Saw a park at Hatkhola. Went in. Marriage was going. We sat on a concrete bench. I finally held her. Her hands so smooth. I didn't want to go home. After staying for some time children were gathering around us. We moved.

Went inside hotel Divyaratna nearby. Went inside to a private place. Ordered two Pepsi. Alone, we held hands, caressed, talked. I could feel her breathe. So warm. I couldn't hold myself back. So I turned her and kissed. Kissed on her soft lips, cheek, neck. Felt sooo intimate. Then looked at her eyes. So beautiful. Kissed her again. Suddenly heard a door slam and backed down. Waiter came. We were finished. So got out. She paid.
Then slowly went towards her home. Left her close to shanti chowk. Then returned.

Met momy at gudri. returned with her.
