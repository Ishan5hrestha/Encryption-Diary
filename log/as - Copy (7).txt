Am I soooo good looking?

Last friday, I was going to college at about 10:30 am. I was walking on the.road just outside the colege. 5-6 girls of HM were towards my direction laughing and smiling. When we past each other, one of them remarked about my muffler. I turned back. They sung " farki farki na hera malai". I laughed and went to college.

Am I really that good looking?

It has been a long time I haven't talked to my love.
No progress with Samikshya yet. Yesterday I was making eye contact with her. She stared at me. I felt shy and looked away. hahahaha.
