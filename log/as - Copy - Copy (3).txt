BREAK UP

Its over. Its all over. When i returned from college yesterday, she
messaged me on Facebook about we should stop talking for we can't be
together in future. When i called and asked what happened, she told me not
to call anymore. Her tone sounded like she was in tears. What could I say?
I said OK , i won't call anymore ever. Then cut the line. Then blocked her
on Facebook. I cant take it anymore. She always talk about being apart.

I always try to convince her not to think so. So its better it has end here.

But I miss her. I miss her soo much. Sometimes I think she left me for
someone else. But sometimes i feel she misses me too and will call soon.
Its 12 am June 23. Haven't got a single call. I feel she must have really
got over me. Maybe she is happy enjoying with someone else. I had unblocked
her today. I thought she might message me. I really miss her.

Still now i wont do anything. If she still cares, she will call. But maybe
she no longer wants me. Doesn't matter. I m always sad. Sometimes I think i
should have smashed her during holidays. I feel bad. I hate her soo much. Y
is she doing this. Doesn't matter. I have to get over her.

Yesterday was mommy's birthday. I had forgotten. Only when i returned and
saw Facebook i remembered and called.


I feel terribly sad.
