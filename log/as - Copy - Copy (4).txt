THE IMPERFECTION
Yesterday at about noon she confessed why she was imperfect for me. During second semester, she met a guy, Bikal Thapaliya who liked her. Always waited for her while returning to Biratnagar. She liked him. But later thought about me and pushed him back. That was the time we used to talk every night 2 hours. I don't understand how she could like him. She refused to block him saying it isn't the solution. Neither let me see her messeges. She pleaded a lot. But today, she tried to change things she said yesterday. Thats very hurtful. She tried to make me feel wrong. Though its all past things, but its hurtful. It was the time I suspected absolutely nothing.
Even nowadays she doesn't block people I want her to. Insecurity has grown alot. She knows it. Still her actions remain same. She doesn't want to change anything.
Thats nothing special at all. A woman can never be trusted blind folded. Everybody always knew that. I too. Just never took it seriously.
She is just an ordinary girl. Nothing special like I felt.
